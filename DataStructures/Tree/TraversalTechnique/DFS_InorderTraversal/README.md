## Inorder Traversal

Follows the Left-Root-Right pattern, such that:
    -   The left subtree is traversed first
    -   Then the root node for that subtree is traversed
    -   Finally, the right subtree is traversed

        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \
    D   E

    D -> B -> E -> A ->C

Note: Apply inoder traversal on a Binary Search Tree will result in a ordered lists of nodes.
