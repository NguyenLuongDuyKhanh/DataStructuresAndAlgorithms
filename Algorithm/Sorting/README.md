## Selection sort
It sorts an array by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and swapping it with the first unsorted element.
### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n2) ,as there are two nested loops
- Auxiliary Space: O(1) as the only extra memory used is for temporary variables.

## Bubble sort
- Time Complexity: O(n2)
- Auxiliary Space: ùëÇ(1)

## Insertion sort
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Worst case: O(n 2 ) , If the list is in reverse order
