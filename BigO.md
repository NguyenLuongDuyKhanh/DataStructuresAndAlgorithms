## Auxiliary space
It refers to the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm, aside from the input data
Constant Space: 𝑂(1)
 - Uses a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

Linear Space: 𝑂(𝑛)
 - Space grows linearly with the input size.

Logarithmic Space: 𝑂(log⁡𝑛)
 - Space grows logarithmically with the input size.
 
Quadratic Space: 𝑂(𝑛2)
 - Space grows quadratically with the input size.

## Time complexity
It describes how the runtime of an algorithm grows relative to the input size.
Constant Time: 𝑂(1)
 - The runtime remains constant regardless of the input size.

Logarithmic Time: 𝑂(log𝑛)
 - The runtime increases logarithmically as the input size grows.

Linear Time: 𝑂(𝑛)
 - The runtime increases linearly with the input size.

Linearithmic Time: 𝑂(𝑛log⁡𝑛)
 - The runtime grows in proportion to 𝑛 multiplied by log⁡𝑛.

Quadratic Time: 𝑂(𝑛2)
 - The runtime increases quadratically with the input size.

Cubic Time: 𝑂(𝑛3)
 - The runtime grows cubically as the input size increases.

Exponential Time: 𝑂(2𝑛)
 - The runtime doubles with each additional element in the input.

Factorial Time: 𝑂(𝑛!)
 - The runtime grows factorially with the input size, which is extremely fast-growing.
